Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied or express warranty or condition lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to You.  This limited express warranty gives You specific legal rights, and You may also have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  

Some jurisdictions require additional warranties or minimum warranty periods that cannot be waived, disclaimed or otherwise varied by contract.  If and to the extent such local laws are held to apply to this Agreement or the Package, the foregoing warranty and/or warranty period shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to comply with the applicable requirements of law, while retaining to the maximum extent possible the effect, scope and economic benefit of the original warranty provided herein.

Any replacement Product shall be warranted for the remainder of the original Warranty Period or thirty (30) days from receipt thereof, whichever is longer.  This limited warranty shall not be applicable and shall be void if the defect or problem with the Product is found to be the result of abuse, unreasonable use, mistreatment or neglect.  Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of relief, incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to You.
